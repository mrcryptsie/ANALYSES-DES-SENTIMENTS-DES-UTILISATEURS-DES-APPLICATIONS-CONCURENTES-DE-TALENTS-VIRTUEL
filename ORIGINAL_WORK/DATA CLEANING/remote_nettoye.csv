remote.com,"By far the easiest and most professional EOR out thereWe've used Remote for 14 employees in Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica and India. Before using Remote, we used another EOR. Remote's service is impeccable, their platform is really easy to use, and their billing operations are very streamlined.

remote.com,"Terrible service that does not comply with labor regulationsIt is a good service until you need anything from them. Their support system is a total disaster and a waster of time. They are a proxy between you and your country's team. Imagine having a conversation through a person who doesn't know anything at all about your country labor legislation and that every question takes a day to answer because they need to confirm with a specialized team. Also, be aware, if you work in Spain, Remote does not comply with the Spanish Labor regulations, IE: They don't track working hours, they don't apply the changes to  the working agreements announced by the government, they don't comply with the  CBA maximum, they don't offer the medical checks every year, etc. Problem is, they don't even know most of these things, you need to create support cases proving how they have to do their HR job, which is a shame.I really hope they get a labor inspection and they receive the sanction they deserve.Date of experience: December 20, 2023",4

remote.com,"Horrible onboarding experience3 Onboarding Specialists & several tickets later, I now have a gap in my employment history due to their lack of professionalism.  December is a busy time for most people. It is also a month when people usually take vacations. Coincidentally, for me, December was also the month when I was supposed to receive my new employment contract from Remote, with my start date being January 1st, 2024. Between December 8th and January 2nd, 2024, the only updates I received were either that my Onboarding Specialists were chasing updates and they'd get back to me shortly, or they out of office notifications. Thus, I ended up with 3 different onboarding specialists and no contract until January 2nd. On January 2nd, in the evening, I finally received the long-awaited contract! Guess what? The start date was wrong, it was January 3rd - in the second half of December, my new manager informed Remote that my start date should be changed from January 3rd to January 1st.Not only was it the wrong start date on my contract, but they were now claiming that it could not be changed anymore because it would mean backdating the contract. To add to that, I had to sign the contract on the day else my start date would be pushed to a later one. So here I am, with a gap in my employment history because I left my previous role because I was supposed to start on January 1st in this new role. Now, I can only start on January 3rd.Let me just reiterate that during this whole time, starting with December 8th - January 2nd, all the information I received revolved around ""I am chasing updates"". The entire onboarding experience has been horrific and stressful. The lack of communication, constantly having to chase updates because people were not replying and/or going on vacation without letting me know that they'd refer the case to someone else so I'd have to open a new ticket, and the pressure to sign the contract on that evening elsewise they would have to push the startdate, this was an awful experience. I was employed via Remote before. Apart from a couple of mistakes in my contract, the onboarding experience was alright. They were corrected after I pointed them out. This time, however, the experience was nothing short of stressful and its results have nevatively impacted my pension&social contributions in the long run.Date of experience: January 02, 2024",4

remote.com,"Cool product, but bad executionThe concept and platform are impressive. But this all only helps until something stops working, this is when the execution falls short, especially from an employee's perspective. I relocated from Germany to Spain, and there was absolutely no support provided, despite having already paid for a full year of Remote services while in Germany. Getting a new spanish contract was an excruciatingly slow process, requiring constant follow-ups, and each time, I dealt with a different person who seemed unaware of prior discussions or agreements. It became incredibly exhausting. They even refused to get me a socialsecruity number, that has to be requested by the EMPLOYER since a new law. I had to try it myself first and be denied, follow up twice with them AND complain at my company until they stepped in and even charged to get the number. The number was obligatory to create the contract...In the end, I missed out on a €70,000 tax reduction in Spain over a period of 5 years because Remote never communicated the fact that I could take advantage of the Beckham Law. I only discovered this opportunity through someone else who was inquiring about Remote as a potential user. So, convincing new individuals to use Remote may be achievable, but they don't seem interested in helping existing employees save money.Once I realized this, it was already too late for me to apply. Moreover, I received no assistance in this matter. They could have made an effort to assist me, such as writing a letter to the tax authorities, but they didn't seem to care, all while charging me €600 per month, with minimal effort required on their part once the contract was in place.Up until the tax issue arose, I had been recommending Remote to everyone on social media who was seeking opportunities to work abroad for their companies. However, I'm now considering switching to a more affordable competitor.Edit: If you would have wanted to helped me and you are a collaborator of the spanish tax regime you COULD and still CAN - or at least trying to help me. Writing a excuse letter for the delay and asking for kindness for example would have way more impact (as a big company that the tax regime is willed to keep in the country) than me doing it. You just do not want to and going the easy way of saying ""Sorry you missed out, we have better processes in place now"" and keep cashing the 600€ per month with the least amount of effort.Thanks for nothing. And yes, you might have it in place now for this specific case. But it's very representative for any other opportunities who people run risk to lose money, because you are relying on your customers telling you about what you should do proactively.And last but not least, everytime I reach out to the support its like ""We understand your frustration, we are interested in your feedback, but we won't do anything for YOU"". It's annoying and a reason why I not even try anymore.Date of experience: September 13, 2023",4

The worst part of the service is their inflexibility. My money was withheld from me for a month anytime I received a bonus or in the case of my severance package. When I tried to resolve the issue I was met with unprofessional responses and poorly made screenshots of our contracts to remind me that everything they do is legal. I don’t doubt the legality, but I don’t think that’s a way of approaching the people who pay you.

The web application has a decent and readable interface with an interactive chat for more immediate and individual help.In my opinion the most noticeable drawback is a quite slow tempo to actually process some documents/procedures, because there are 3rd parties involved, which may have their own additional queues of people (clients) and it's sometimes necessary to engage in an extra communication (fortunately also supported by Remote consultants), if something needs to be additionally explained or speed up.Generally i can recommend the Remote platform and i hope my experience is going to be even better over time. :)Date of experience: May 31, 2023",4

remote.com,"Very good onboarding process, with room for improvementI just started my experience with Remote so I can only speak about their onboarding process. I may add a more comprehensive review in a few months to evaluate the full experience.The task for Remote is not an easy one, here in Poland: taxes are complex and frankly the 4-way communication between ""Remote-Employee-Actual Employer-Company that owns the actual employer"" is hard to manage, everywhere.Overall, I had a very positive experience and I would like to highlight the peaks on both sides.My positives are:- Very good responsivness and competence from Danae: she managed to answer everything up to smallest detail. So big shut out to her and the Poland team!- It's good to have one single place for all paperwork: I am so happy I don't have to keep hard copies of all the stuff I sign!Negatives:- Process not perfectly tweaked: We had a meeting with all parties involved (like I said, 4 of them). In this meeting the most common problems were addressed and each one of us had question. However I didn't feel I wanted to share all my questions with everyone. After that meeting I booked an individual one where all my doubts were solved but we were on a very short time frame so it was a bit stressful. Of course the need of questions would have been smaller if there were more details in the initial pdf we received. So I suggest to have the first onboarding meeting earlier so that people know whom they could contact for clarifications and provide more detailed information about the contract upfront.Not sure if these are problems that are caused by remote:- It was a bit tricky to get the after tax estimation of my salary: I got it eventually but it got lost a little bit in the communication channel between the companies.- Short timeframe for the onboarding process: we only had a bit more than a week to complete all the process (meetings, agreements, paperwork, etc). I would have preferred start much earlier.Date of experience: June 01, 2023",4

remote.com,"A great service unless something goes wrongEDIT: The below issues have now (finally) been resolved after many hours of back and fourth, 2 video meetings, and multiple additional mid-payroll-cycle payments.Unfortunately, I believe I only received the level of support that I did in large part to the negative review.This has been one of the most stressful things I have ever been through, while also having a newborn child.I was considering upping my rating to 3 stars because of the resolution but they just emailed me all their in-country customers' email addresses (and so them, mine) through an ill-conceived and unsolicited calendar invitation. They can't catch a break.---For a year I had no issues using Remote. Onboarding was easy, their dashboard is great to use, and I was able to request various documents for things like purchasing a house.However, in the last few months they have made some severe mistakes. One prevents me from contributing to a pension (even privately away from Remote) and also involved incredibly awkward conversations with my employer.The second resulted in only being paid half of my salary due to multiple mistakes and wildly inaccurate deductions for parental leave.One issue has no resolution and one is still ongoing but Remote sent me a link to review them while in the middle of all this. Weird.I can only assume that they are suffering from scaling their business to meet demand. The alternative is that they are incompetent so I hope it's the former.Oh, and there is no dedicated person to reach out to for anything. You have to use their stupid chat widget which spews links to help articles until it decides you can leave a message.I hope they resolve my issues, and I hope their level of service recovers. I want them to succeed, but they have let me down significantly.Date of experience: May 30, 2023",4

remote.com,"Overly prices payroll services and poor customer serviceOur experience with Remote started nearly a year ago but their customer service hasn't been consistent throughout and their prices are outrageous. Their team in Morocco lacks the knowledge of local labor laws which made the onboarding process of our employees not go well. One of our employees mistakenly received a substantial $ amount for his paycheck which was a large mistake that shouldn't have happened. Currently, we are still battling to get them to process the payroll of one of our contractors. When it comes to their fees, it was quite straightforward with only one cost however it's quite expensive to charge $7000+ for an employee overseas. They are starting a new payment program however for small businesses we have yet to see the benefit of using it. They were very responsive when we were first considering them but as time has gone by they have become less responsive, especially to our staff.Date of experience: January 20, 2023",4

remote.com,"Very Positive ExperienceWe have been working with Remote since late 2021, with the vast majority of onboarding taking place in 2022. My overall experience has been very good and positive!At first, we were working with a customer representative, who was overall competent and helpful. However, when we started to bring in more people to the organization, things started to fall through cracks a bit. We genuinely care about our employees having a great experience while onboarding, so we brought these issues up with Remote. They responded immediately and we came up with a better system of tracking all the information, which worked really well. As we continued to grow, we were introduced to a new senior customer representative, Sarah, who is fabulous, knowledgeable, and is one of the best collaborators I have ever worked with. Response time to all of our inquires has been very quick, communication has been transparent, and consequently, we have been able to successfully onboard approximately 45 people since 2022 (and more to come).Some advantages and concrete examples of the positive assessment of working with Remote:* User friendly platform for onboarding and managing employees that is continuously being updated and new functions are added - some functions might not be available yet, but I notice improvements and changes being implemented on a regular basis (e.g., Onboarding section, requests button, employee cost calculator).* Onboarding and offboarding processes are well described in the platform and easy to follow.  * There is a lot of information in the Country Explorer section on Remote's website, including onboarding time for available countries, benefits information, public holidays, and more.* Remote offers generous resources on hiring (on the website, but also webinars), which can be quite helpful.* Remote's pricing and fees are affordable and they have 4 different plans that support different types of organizations (e.g., startups or nonprofits).I think one of the greatest benefits of working with Remote is that they continuously make improvements (if a feature is not available today, it doesn't mean that it won't be in the next few weeks / months) and they grow their teams in terms of capacity, but also knowledge. Mistakes happen everywhere, but for me, it's about how they are addressed and what is done to prevent similar mistakes from happening in the future. Remote is open to feedback and I believe that if collaboration is not at the place where it should be, there is room for change and creative solutions, which I appreciate a lot. Based on my experience, I would recommend Remote as an Employer of Record!Date of experience: January 04, 2023",4

I was left alone to find out how evertything worked and deal with the tax office and when I passed the information to remote I was told that I was wrong over and over again.In addition, the contract contained things which didn't make sense and was vastly over-restrictive.These things were only resolved with the intervention of the company hiring me through remote, but they were resolved.I don't feel I can go to remote for advice of how to deal with the tax authorities or to find out what I'm entitled to.Date of experience: August 31, 2022",4

remote.com,"Remote.com doesn't care about employees, only their employers, and it shows.I was an employee with Remote.com outside of the US.  The entire experience has been awful.  First, they took over 2 months in getting me my contract, and I had to initiate the request. If they work in a country, they should understand how a country operates regarding employment.  Their support people have been friendly.. but generally unhelpful, and in multiple cases I've had to assume the effort to ensure that payments that they've failed to make to me actually happened, which involved multiple follow-ups and escalation within my company.  In a lot of cases, I've had to assume what is essentially another part-time job to make sure that they are fulfilling their obligations.If they screw up on payment, they refuse to do one-offs to make it right, so you are stuck waiting 30 days and hoping they've fixed it.  When they screwed up my payroll, they did it two months in a row so it was 3 months before I was actually getting my correct salary amount.There's not a single contact (or set of contacts) for my other company, so if I need help I have to go through their general support, and deal with a different person every time.I don't know what it's like on the employer side, but as an employee, I've found it incredibly hostile and not really useful.Date of experience: December 14, 2022",4
