deel.com,"Stole $10K+ from small business & overcharged interest on invoicesDo not sign up for Deel as an employer of record for your company!  We had two deposits with Deel as we used them for our Employer of Record.  After we completed our contracts and asked Deel to apply our deposit to our final invoices, we never heard back from the customer success team.  We attempted to contact them for many months about this.  During that time, Deel charged interest on the unpaid invoices.  We therefore went ahead and paid the final invoices for our account so that they would in turn return our deposit.  They only repaid a portion of one deposit.  We have been contacting them weekly for more than 4 months now and they have still not returned our deposit.  This is a serious fraud and unfair given the interest charged on our previously unpaid final invoices given they have not held up their end of the bargain and repaid our deposit once we closed our account AND completed the payments including for the unfair interest charged.  The total they have not refunded us is over $10,000!!Date of experience: January 01, 2024",1

Obviously, there is some inherent stress in dealing with any complex system, but it's more than that. As a YC founder, every second you are thinking about something other than your company is a second wasted. So you have to figure out how to get immigration right without losing focus. Thankfully Deel and Ahmed Mousa have been amazing allies in navigating this whole process. Always on the ball, Ahmed has answered my endless questions with patience, and there have been a ton of them. He has helped me quickly understand my options and find the best path forward. His mix of professionalism and genuine care for his clients is something you don't see every day. Big shoutout to him for being a fantastic partner in my journey and making me feel like I have a friend in the process. If you're founder trying to figure out U.S. immigration, Ahmed's your man.

deel.com,"Their bug resulted in my underpayment of estimated taxes to the IRSIf you are a U.S. contractor receiving foreign currency pay, refuse to work through Deel. Everything seemed great until I received my 1099-NEC. The USD amount reported on my 1099-NEC for pay received in EUR used an arbitrary exchange rate that resulted in reporting an income much higher than what I actually received (using either spot or forward rates) and what the invoices that Deel themselves had generated reported as my USD pay. This resulted in my underpayment of estimated taxes to the IRS.After 2 weeks of back and forth with customer service, during which I had to push and push for answers to my actual concern and during which I was not allowed direct contact with the technical team actually in charge of this issue, the conclusion from their side was:1. There was a technical bug in the exchange rates used by the invoices that they generated (the exchange rates I used to pay my estimated taxes since I had assumed Deel knew what they were doing and since they were close to the spot rates at the time I was paid)2. The inflated USD amount reported on the 1099-NEC was ""correct"" and should be used in filing my taxes, even though it used an exchange rate that they could not clearly explain and resulted in an underpayment of my estimated taxes3. A simple sorry for the inconvenienceDeel's website and UI is sleek, so it can give you the impression that they know what they're doing, but critical mistakes like this that are fundamental to dealing with international contractors show that they are not reliable and take no responsibility for their mistakes.Date of experience: January 24, 2024",1

It was closed after 10 days, without beeing solved. They send auto generated messages and people with no knowledge called twice. Issue number two: I signed a contract 1st and the system marked 6th as starting date, even though the contract I signed  said 1st. And all required documents were uploaded at least 2 days upfront to the starting date (except the contract which was uploaded 1st). Instead of correcting it, they ask to ask my employer for a ""bonus"" compensation for the 6 missing days. If I add up the time*hourly rates of the manager, the accountant and myself to compensate Deel's own start date with my ""bonus"", who pays for the extra time? The support chatbot is completely useless. In the next instance, the so-called specialists use text modules. The messages are not there to better understand or solve the problem, but rather to gain time and play message ping-pong regardless of the details or problems brought to their attention.

The response from Deel was tremendously fast, they contacted me, explained the situation once again, took note of my feedback and promised to consider making changes to the user flow, and refunded the advance costs. Frankly, I'm impressed with the level of customer service! Leaving the original review for the full picture↓Have been using it for a few months as a contractor and everything worked pretty well until I got an email about Deel Advance. Was curious about how it works and started the process, however after seeing the supposed timeline I didn't make the final request (or at least I thought I didn't). What was my surprise when I got a letter that the advance had been repaid in the end of month. Support was fast and responsive but said that it couldn't do anything at this point. So I ended up losing money on advance I didn't even used (there was no communication about it being delivered into my account).Quite sad situation because as I said I like the service so far, but this experience was disappointing. I basically felt forced into this service with dark UI or something (maybe it was me being dumb but then it's jut unclear UI, and who knows how many other moments there are in the app where you can slip up).Long story short, be wary about the additional features, they can be costly!Date of experience: December 05, 2023",5

All this can be set up when you create a contract with them. I do wish there were real-time updates on the system, though. Their Support team has been super helpful and knowledgable but it can be quite time-consuming, especially for businesses, to have to start a chat or send an email and wait for a response just to get an update on an existing issue.

However, deel managed (again because of a third party issue) to submit my monthly earnings multiple times to HMRC making a mess out of my taxes and sending me to a higher tax code. They are trying to solve it :sigh: Because of an issue with a third party integration, deel wrongly added expenses to my gross pay so they got taxed and they shouldn't have been. This has been impossible to resolve after a week and now deel has come to the conclusion I'm owed no money and closed my ticket.

Ahmed in our first call gave such clear expectations for my O1 application that I decided to go with Legalpad (now Deel). Got my O1 approved swiftly after.

If Deel can't handle this, it should pay by the day and not at the end of the month.The terms of service say they don't solve disputes. However, this is not a matter of solving a dispute, this is a matter of already delivered services simply being ""deleted"" from the platform. Retroactively.If someone signs a contract for ""X hours per day"", then those hours can't be simply canceled after the service has already happened.But Deel says this is a dispute and they won't get involved.I was stolen over 2000 USD.I won't be using this anymore, since it doesn't offer any protection to the service-provider.

deel.com,"Deel keeps holding payments, loose documents and support takes days to respondDeel keeps holding payments, cannot find transactions, looses documents and delays releasing payments to vendors.We have been working with Deel for over a year now. We have multiple instance of payments not released to contractors for weeks because finance team does not detect the payment.In the UK bank transfers are instant. There is no excuse to hold the payments for a week or 2. Even when we chat with the support, they just have to wait for days to get a response from their finance team even when we provide bank transactions.Another problem is contractor documents sometimes just get deleted by Deel and there is no way to recover them.

deel.com,"I didn’t get my last salary and they even forgot to deregister me from the Social Security company!The most horrible company I have ever dealt with! It all started wrong - at first they sent me some old template for the contract (I was lucky I was actually reading the stuff and found out it was a bit strange), then they sent me good template of contract but my name was wrong. When I asked them to correct my name, they sent me again wrong template but with correct name. It was endless! My company was hiring me for more than 3 weeks because each correction took 3 or more business days. The CEO of our company was very mad at Deel! Later I found out that if I didn’t literally request data for taxes declaration, I would never get the necessary papers (and according to my country legislation, I should be given this automatically by the employer). Although I had right to ask them to make all the taxes declaration, I was afraid of leaving this stuff up to Deel, because after all that happened, I had zero trust towards them. Then our company went into financial troubles and most of the employees had to terminate their employment, including me. And that’s when another bad story started - according to my country legislation, the employer is obliged to deregister the employee from the Social Insurance company one day after the termination of the employment at the latest. They haven’t deregistered me for more than one month after I terminated. Thanks to this, I wasn’t able to get the social security benefits until now. And what else? Until now, which is over a month and a half, I still didn’t get my last payroll and the last salary. I have contacted their support at least 3 times due to this and all I get is “it will be soon” and “we apologize for the inconvenience”. When I ask what “soon” means, I get no specific answer, just “we hope it will be soon, we will keep you updated” and again apologies. After this horrific experience with Deel, I don’t want to deal with them in the future and I strongly recommend everyone to think about freelancing better than having to experience all of this.

deel.com,"HorribleI recently had the unfortunate experience of dealing with Deel's customer service, and I must say, it was absolutely horrendous. The level of assistance I received was beyond disappointing and left me feeling frustrated and helpless.I reached out to Deel's customer service team with a pressing issue that I needed help resolving. Not only did it take an eternity to get a response, but when I finally did, the representative seemed disinterested and unhelpful from the very start. It was as if they couldn't be bothered to address my concerns seriously.As I tried to explain my problem, the representative's responses were vague and lacking in any real solutions. It felt like they were simply copy-pasting generic responses without actually understanding the specifics of my issue.Despite my attempts to provide additional information and clarify the situation, the customer service agent stopped reply.  This level of negligence and incompetence is simply unacceptable, especially when seeking assistance with something as critical as a problem with their service.After wasting valuable time going back and forth with the customer service representative, I still found myself no closer to a resolution. The lack of empathy and genuine concern for my issue was astonishing. It's disheartening to think that a company like Deel, which claims to provide comprehensive support, could fail so spectacularly in this regard.In conclusion, my experience with Deel's customer service was nothing short of a nightmare. The lack of professionalism, the inability to comprehend my problem, and the overall apathetic attitude displayed by their representative has left me with a sour taste in my mouth. I would strongly advise others to think twice before relying on Deel's customer service for any kind of assistance, as it's more likely to exacerbate your problems rather than solve them.Date of experience: August 10, 2023",1

This time, they wanted to escalate it.After seven more days, I received a reminder to answer to the email that Deel sent to me - without ever having received the original email. They asked me to provide a lot of data to proof my identity, of which half can be easily found on the internet and the other half is something I would prefer not to share through an email.I anyway provided everything they asked for. A bit later, I received another reminder from another person at Deel apologizing for having sent the first email to the email address I had at my old employer and asking me for the exact same data again. I told them that I already provided the data and luckily, I was granted with access the very same day.All in all a quite bumpy and lengthy process and especially the amount of personal data that needs to be shared through an insecure channel like email is worrying me.Date of experience: August 09, 2023",2

deel.com,"Tough start (2020) - incredible improvement in 2022We started working with deel end of 2020. The platform was already great from both employer and employee side. What was really lacking was experienced support. The answers from the support were not to the point, required several back and forth, on a chat that would wait for the support agent to connect for over an hour, but close after 5 minutes of their answer if you didn't reply. Therefore, I often had to re-write and re-explain things wholly to a different customer support agent. Very annoying. It's only when we did the first termination in November 2021, that I could see a real customer support improvement. The case was complex as it was linked to residential visa and we were looking for a way for our employee to change job, but not country. Carlos was amazing at supporting us and trying to find a solution. Also over Christmas and New Year's. We had another termination in April, in another country and with another great deel support experience. A year ago, I would have never recommended deel. In  early 2021 I felt like I was training their customer support who didn't understand the difference pay and legal consequences of my questions. In 2022, I would  recommend deel for their support and incredibly easy platform, where both employee and employer have access to all the information they need.Date of experience: June 13, 2023",4

deel.com,"Worst mobility/EOR companyWorst mobility company. I am not sure how they have been getting good reviews. Deel is supposed to make it easy to onboard and off board employees abroad but they are No special than just outsourcing to a local company in the country. If not, WAY WORSE.  In order to get anything out of them such as a simple signature it takes almost one week. They don’t respond back to you in a timely manner even though you have dedicated CSMs. They also have no idea how to help you right away. I don’t see Deel being sustainable in the long run. They get a lot of press for growing quickly but the service absolutely sucks. They also charge you for every little request. I just need a document signed to be offloaded and they are asking my company for 700usd otherwise they won’t sign. So I’m pretty much held hostage until the finance team pays. Things like this make me dislike the brand because they care more about the money than your individual client’s concerns and urgency. I would never recommend them to anyone! Use local agencies like TASC or Rosemont because they treat customers better.Date of experience: June 01, 2023",1

deel.com,"Dreadful - Avoid **Updated**: Later Experience Saw an ImprovementDreadful, they've cost me time and money. The salesperson said I could be a sole trader on the platform and use my credit card for payments. The first issue is that there's no formal documentation they will accept proving you're self-employed. In the UK, nothing exists, the tax office doesn't issue a self-employment number, and Deel doesn't accept your national insurance number. I had to use my limited company certificate supported by a personal credit card statement. That was still not accepted. I give up. I highly recommend you stay with Upwork if you're considering moving. They allowed me to create six contracts during this period, all six will have to be wound down. There's been a time and money expense for which I'll attempt to get compensation.**Update on this**After posting the above review, Deel's COO contacted me directly and fixed the issue. The system does allow for credit card payments for sole traders. It seems my account was flagged to compliance, who took a narrow approach to my application.  To the COO's credit, I'm going to continue with Deel. I will leave the original review because it's an important part of the context, but I've given more stars - driven by the later experience of the COO reaching out.Date of experience: May 31, 2023",3

I had a couple nuanced situations that I needed to work through and that team was unhelpful and it took weeks to resolve issues that shouldn't have taken that long. It probably depends on who you get as your CS rep but I was unhappy with the level of support that we got from ours.

As I understood it, Deel or this guy in particular were not interested in a small client like us (just hiring 1-2 people) so didn't bother to answer at all.I then reached out to a competitor and had a call and an offer from them right away (with a discount, the service is also nice and user-friendly).I didn't even want to write a review here as I hoped someone would contact me to ask if I was still interested, but I could not find any contact details so the easiest way was to leave my review here.Date of experience: March 31, 2023",2

deel.com,"Terrible ExperienceI am very disappointed with Deel as I had a terrible experience as an employee and as a result of Deel a simple task of signing a contract took nearly 1 whole month! The Deel onboarding is confusing - they told me  my contract is ready to sign but when I get in the platform to sign there's an error message and turns out there are multiple steps required before I'm able to sign and no instructions to tell me that. After speaking to multiple customer service ppl I found out I needed to upload a document first but there's nowhere on the Deel platform to upload that document. Back and forth with customer support, I was contacted by a few different teams saying conflicting things and the problem still persists after nearly 2 weeks of customer support. I rarely leave bad reviews but I am so so so disappointed by Deel that I need to speak of my experience so they can listen and improve.Date of experience: March 24, 2023",1

The link for a call back did not work and she once again sent me and I was able to book. She called as expected and offered me the best solution where I can say I am super satisfied! The main issue was not resolved but she explained everything to me and did not ask me to ""wait"" like most agents did. They made me wait with no follow up. Horrible experience with them.

The day that they do payroll for employees on a not EOR model is the day they can have all my coins! Seriously, I would recommend Deel to anyone hiring globally. I currently use it to pay global contractors and global team members on the EOR model. It'd be my dream to have ALL of our team members on Deel for ease of use. What I also love is their product is constantly evolving and getting updated to be even better, further demonstrating that they're not satisfied with good enough and that they're always looking to raise the bar! My one piece of feedback that I consistently share is I want to see better permissions for admins. The permissions are currently very limited, and I want to have more control over who can see what. Not a make or break for us right now, but something we really hope to see in the future as our team scales.Date of experience: February 08, 2023",5

They also do not mention it in the contract or verbally as if this can't possibly create problems for us as employees when trying to do something with our hard earned money as mortgage loans. Then they claim that opening a local bank account is something that takes a while (it's been a year now, stop lying). Then I change the bank account details IN TIME (before the cut-off date) and they still manage to pay out the salary to the WRONG bank account and now aren't able to answer why it happened, completely disregarding the fact that we as employees might have closed the previous bank account and if we update the info in the app it's for a reason. Now they are incapable of answering why it happened or provide any reassurance that it won't happen again.

deel.com,"Deel now holds 2477.43 USD. Won't refundUPD: our case was solved pretty quick after this review publication and my 'very loud' request to Deel support team. Thank you.Excellent service when it comes to receiving payments and paying employees.However, support is absolutely awful. Deel now holds our money in the amount of 2 477.43 USD and does nothing when we ask for a refund.We paid two invoices in the wrong currency, and Deel could not proceed with them. Deel Payments team contacted us and proposed two options:""1. We can cancel this invoice for you so that you can reprocess the invoice in the currency that we have received. Please note that there may be slight differences in the final amount due to currency changes.2. You can resend the amount in the correct currency. As soon as you send us a proof of payment, we will process the invoice to prevent delays. We can then collect bank details to refund the initial payment back to you.""To be honest, the instructions are a bit confusing, so we chose the first option. We thought that already made payments would be cancelled and refunded (!), since Deel confirmed that they had received them.We declined to use Deel for the first payment of 1,514.93 USD, and for the second payment of 962.50 USD we used another invoice and made the payment in the correct currency (our payments were supposed to be in EUR but since we were using Deel for the first time, we made this mistake).I have contacted support at least three or four times. I said that we made a mistake choosing an option, and we need a refund for invoices that have already been paid. They don't understand what we're asking of them. They claim to have paid the same invoice (of course, it is an entirely different invoice and payment). Everything seems fine for Deel, and it makes me feel like I'm the only idiot here.Date of experience: December 07, 2022",4

deel.com,"Not so great for European contractorsThe customer support is lovely, but not well equipped to deal with withdrawal problems for European contractors.I started having problems with receiving my paycheck from Deel through Wise last month. I've received confirmation from Wise that they have received my funds and sent them to me but the money never arrived. This is the second time in a row this has happened.As per Deel's guidelines, I must wait 5 business days before they can take action.Last time I waited the 5 business days so a full week in total when including the weekend (during which Deel's customer support assured me I would receive my money - and didn't) and only an hour after the issue was escalated I received my money from Wise. It's just a matter of them releasing it. Wise's bank is located in Belgium. They've previously sent the funds as SEPA instant transfers which take mere seconds between 2 European bank accounts. That's why it's so frustrating to be asked to wait for days.That said I am really unhappy I must go through the waiting period again before getting help. I tried to explain that this is not the first time this has happened and last time things didn't get sorted out on their own but I felt that nobody really read what I was writing and just copy pasted info from the FAQ. I would've rather had the support really take the time to listen to my concerns and escalate the problem to the payments team to check just in case, letting them know what happened last time.Unfortunately Wise is the only free option to withdraw money from Deel for me. I'm unsatisfied with the platform and am researching other options to get paid as a contractor. Having to wait a week for a transfer within Europe is not justifiable in today's world. I need quicker action from Deel and cannot keep chasing my money, as surely this will happen again. This is doing serious damage to my mental health and personal finances. This only started happening last month and nobody believes me that it's not normal. Before that, I always received my money within just hours.I would recommend that EU-based remote workers consider using another platform that perhaps has customer support based in Europe for faster and more accurate help when it comes to withdrawals.Date of experience: November 29, 2022",3

deel.com,"Deel is hiding fees for withdrawal methodsI am using Deel to receive my salary from a client. Deel has advertised a new ""instant card transfer"" withdrawal method without warning users that this transfer takes quite a significant fee. When I went through the steps to activate this withdrawal method the fee was never once mentioned. I must say I was pretty surprised when I realized the difference between my salary and what arrived in my bank account. After three days of contacting customer support, nobody apologized or helped me in any way. They just provided me links to articles where the fee is mentioned. It's ridiculous to me that the fee is not mentioned anywhere in the app itself nor in the process of actually activating this withdrawal method.  Oh, and by the way, the transfer was not instant at all. My salary arrived in my bank account as quickly as it did by using a regular bank transfer method (1 to 2 days, without fees).Update:5 days and 5 different customer service employees later Deel decided to refund me the fee I was charged with. Hence changing the rating from 1 star to 3 stars. Still not pleased that this happened and that it took so much effort to reach a conclusion which I feel was only just.Date of experience: October 31, 2022",3

deel.com,"Stay away and find another EOR pleaseThe company hired Deel to sort my work permit in the UAE and it was the most disastrous process I've dealt with.It went on for 2 months only for the lawyer to tell me that they cannot release my entry visa unless I visit the ""Ministry of Foreign Affairs"" in my home country. I asked several times how I can make this appointment and what documents I need to bring. Zero knowledge. Zero expertise. Left it to the employee to spend hours of personal time to find out.Bear in mind it was so difficult to even get prompt replies from the lawyer. Days would go by and follow-ups need to be made only for him to tell me he has no information, timeline, or clear steps.Finally, he told me to apply for a separate tourist visa to enter UAE. I managed to find a way to do this - only to get another surprise that it will take 4+ weeks in the UAE to get the employment permit.We decided to stop this process and find another EOR as the timeline has completely messed up my plans and also gone over the deadline of my probationary period.Only after we told them that we are exploring another EOR did a Mobility rep pop in.

On the next day, I asked them about the status and they decided to forward my case to a different team and that I should be contacted in 48h about the status.There was no contact and I messaged Deel again: they don't know what is happening because the funds were sent to the Payment Processor but Deel can't get an answer from them.I can't reach out to the Payment Processor and I have no idea when I will receive my payment.In summary: Deel works well when there is no problem. in case of problems, they depend on 3rd party services and everything is a black box.Date of experience: October 09, 2022",2

A lot more than you would see with e.g. Wise.And on top of that, they had an incorrect KB article that caused a contract amendment to be finalized too late, resulting in us vastly overpaying an employee. Plus their actual terms means they can delay contract changes at will, leaving you no control of whether the changes will come into effect on time.Also their so called ""localized contracts"" are not actually localized for a lot of countries - so watch out for that as well.Date of experience: September 30, 2022",1

deel.com,"Deel: Advance FeatureDeel platform allows you to perform an action called: ""Advance"". As an independent contractor, often times I happen to find myself in a situation where I need funds in a pinch, so I request Deel to borrow me a certain amount that I will eventually pay off in my next biweekly invoice. Usually it arrives within a few hours (12-16) however this time it took over three days. Naturally I was worried, so I contacted support to review the status of my Advance withdrawal and the service was exceptional. Deel provided me with excellent customer experience by swiftly addressing my concerns, setting at ease the likelihood of me being penniless by the start of a new week. The Advance arrived within the time frame specified by the agent whom attended to me, and I'm very much grateful for that.10/10Date of experience: September 10, 2022",5

Response time is slow = 2-3 days after my email2. Response is not informative, not solving any problems = ""I'll raise this topic and get back to you"". (This takes them 2-3 days.)3. Work ethic is bad = they will never get back to you unless you ping them again. 4. Authority, competency is a non-existing thing: it's at least the 20th person I'm in contact with and passing me to someone else, if... Then the whole circle repeats itself. Respond is familiar: ""I'll raise this topic again and get back to you"". You find yourself in the loop again. It's menthal. Especially because it is about my pre-paid expenses which were not reimbursed properly. I still don't know why. It's not only me. My colleague is having the same issues, our client (the company I'm working for) is having hard times too. I'm truly amazed how a service provider can live, act and survive in such a competitive market in 2022 with this level of incompetence. Also after 2 months of struggling with several issues (8-9 colleagues and myself) I highly doubt that positive reviews are true and not fake. Think twice before vote for Deel as your next employer.

For sure there is no ""get back"".• Address a letter with wrong name (asking for referral –» I guess that's the joke part) and then sending a correction email with the same wrong name.I congratulate Deel to establish a company with these amateur skills and lack of dedication and honestly warn everyone else out there: save yourself and your employees from Deel.

I liked what they stood for and their customer service seemed to be great.  Little did I know, that signing up with them there were so many ""oh by the ways"" - we can't do this, we have to charge you a lot of money and just hold it indefinitely, and oh - we won't give you the proper information until it is too late and we need to bill you an extra month of service.  Straw that broke the camels back and I would highly recommend going with another service or being very careful about interacting with these guys for Full Time employees ... is that they want to charge me a fee to offboard, and then ""reimburse me back right away"" - what is the point of that???  Just don't charge me the fee.  Why are you taking thousands of dollars out of my account when your entire process wasn't what you promised in the first place?

Then, because I couldn't send money out, i wanted to delete my account - but they made me first delete my contract; which would have been fine under most circumstances, but in this one they needed to wait 1 day for the contract to be deleted - they could have just allowed this to happen instantly, but it seems that they want you to NOT delete and they put up yet another road block - Doesn't seem right - just let me leave if I want to leave.

Pretty happy with them nowUpdate:1-2 hrs after I left the past review, they called me and offered to re-enable SWIFT transfers in GBP for my account, together with a refund for a previous withdrawal too. Took their dev team a couple of hours to do this. Can't believe how fast they all handled this. Happy client here. 10/10 phone customer support (the first time I talked to them through the chat app).(Kudos to Rachel for being professional and for the way she talked me through this! 👋)Old review:TL;DR: with their recent changes, I have to do extra legal paperwork, lose 70$/month and they're not even announcing it properly. No transparency and poor support. Strong downvote from me.I work as a contractor and one of the companies I'm working for pays me via Deel. Used to be really pleased with the platform, but they recently did some unannounced changes to their withdrawal process. I'm paid in GBP and used to withdraw to a GBP account at a local bank. Suddenly they don't allow that anymore and force you to exchange GBP to USD or my local currency with their exchange rate, which is worse than what Revolut offers, for example (I lose ~70$/exchange).Support says they only allow withdrawals in USD 'at the moment', but the UI says 180+ currencies and my local currency shows up as an option too, so nothing clear here.

They have a great competence to answer any complex or dumb question I ask them.Also, I feel it is straightforward to use the app and its features.// Not a con but still worth mentioning: Deel is very sticky to their internal guidelines and not really up to any deviations.Once, I wanted to request a Deel card, and Deel continuously declined my address verification requests.I know there are only 2 standard documents allowed to verify your address: a Bank Statement and a Utility Bill. I had none of them and tried using my lease agreement instead (still don't get why the Lease Agreement won't work).However, the other famous fintech service W**e accepted my lease agreement despite having the same address verification requirements......and then I used the W**e bank statement to confirm my address in Deel, how ironic.Date of experience: June 09, 2022",5

deel.com,"Great with promises, awful with execution. You may NEVER get paidAWFUL!! They were super nice when I was  signing up for Deel, made it sound like they thought of everything. Once we were with Deel it all went downhill like a snowball. I signed up for Deel on the 21st of the month, they decided to charge for the last 9 days a FULL MONTHLY platform fee, stating that it does not matter when I join this is how they bill. During those 9 days I got no service nor payroll from them (they pushed paying for those 9 days by one month), meaning had they been honest and just disclosed this I could have save hundreds by signing up a week later or the first of the next month.Try resolving anything with ""customer support"", it is not possible, I chatted with them asking a simple question - does Deel have a phone number for support? That was literally my question, the response I got back was that a ticket has been submitted and I will hear back via email in 3-4 business days, no joke, this was their response. No one ever email me a response.I can somehow live with all the above, the real issue was a week ago my employee was supposed to get paid, he's already onboarded and got his first pay check a few weeks ago, however he did not get his last one, there is a paystub which claims it was paid a week ago but no bank transaction...this could also be forgivable, mistakes do happen...the problem is I have no one to get assistance from. On Chat no one has responded to me in four days, I tried a few emails and also got no response, so my employee's paycheck is over one week late and I have no one to communicate with....so now I will spend hours of my time writing reviews in hope that someone from Deel will see my complaint, acknowledge my request and look into why my employee's salary is over a week late. I must look great having no answers for him...needless to say I will be cancelling Deel. They actually bragged about their 12 billion evaluation during the sales pitch yet you can't get someone to help you if the life of your company depended on it. Pay someone to at least pretend to care about your customers, this platform is worthless.Date of experience: June 06, 2022",1

deel.com,"Deel - ReviewOverall I'm quite satisfied with deel, but I had some issues in the past related to invoice numbering and sometimes with invoice payouts timing.  For example, my monthly recurring bonus, which is just a small amount compared to the main work gets sent before the main work and suddenly I have two invoices instead of just one. And sometimes (probably thanks to this) even numbers are swapped, so they are not sequential.But as I was saying in the beginning - I'm quite satisfied so I would recommend deel.

deel.com,"""Let's Deel"" Is a Poor Slogan Choice for a Human Resources FirmMy company is a med-sized scale-up globally dispersed customer facing service company with operations both in the US and Europe. We used Deel for four months to help expand into new European countries, for which contracted them for payroll service. After one month, it became clear we'd made a mistake choosing Deel. They made repeated payroll errors and then used strong-arm mafia-like tactics to crawl back funds from us and from our employees. The first thing to be aware is that Deel operates virtually in each country, whereby they hire a local law office, bizdev manager and onboarding specialist. The law office is essentially a front and provides no meaningful service to you as the Deel client. The bizdev manager is an untrained former management consultant who is completely unprepared to answer any risk management questions about hiring in a new country, and the onboarding manager is essentially a virtual employee who has no meaningful stake in providing quality service. All of Deel's decisions are made by the North American based managers who know little about the foreign markets they work in. Every question is responded with ""I'll get back to you"". If all of this was not bad enough, they make repeated payroll errors. In our case, which was for a payroll for five employees and monthly expense of  $10k, Deel made over-payment errors on two occasions, including double paying salaries.  Deel uses the deposit you pay as its leverage to force you into cleaning up their mess. You pay a hefty deposit for each employee they hire on your behalf, then when the employee resigns or is fired, Deel holds the deposit until they feel they are made whole even for mistakes of their own making. In our case, they failed to terminate the employee on the date that I directed them to do so, continued to pay the employee, and then realized they had made a mistake and called the former employee to pay back the funds (months later) and then ordered me to pressure the former employee to do so, with the tacit threat that I wouldn't get my deposit back. In that case, the constant calls, emails, texts they made to that former employee was tantamount to illegal harassment. This went on to the point whereby the former employee reported those actions to the local authorities thereby increasing our legal risk exposure, unnecessarily.Another thing to know about Deel is that they charge a monthly fee of about $500 per employee which is very steep. At that rate, it would make more sense to hire a local HR expert who can truly add value and perhaps even help you set up your foreign subsidiary business entity with the savings by not using Deel. The true irony about Deel is that they are a silicon valley globally dispersed platform that exist for one reason, to help other similar type companies handle payroll in other countries, but Deel does not do that one thing well. It does it extremely poorly....so then why do they even exist? They do NOT provide HR service of any kind, no recruiting, no onboarding, no training, no HR support of any kind. The reality is that they will ultimately cost you HR related time and effort and cause frustrations. With their ""I'll get back to you""  response issues get dragged on...issues that impact the livelihood of human beings, your current and former employees, who need resolutions (i.e. receive salaries, receive severance payments, etc). The one thing that Deel does exceptionally well is collect your money, such as your deposit and your payments for the payroll. They are extremely slow at returning your deposit. Even under the right conditions (i.e. no conflicts or disagreements) they will take up to a month to return your deposit, which essentially answers the question, why they exist...they exist solely for FINANCIAL FLOAT, which is to say to arbitrage between the timing of money-in to money-out. They do NOT provide any meaningful foreign business presence, nor shield you from any liability...in fact, through their mistakes and strong arm tactics they actually INCREASE your legal risk exposure. Do not count on their legal team to provide any legal advice nor any tax advice. Imagine yourself in this scenario, you contract Deel to help you hire employees in a new country. You pay Deel a sizeable deposit and hefty monthly fee of $500. Then for whatever reason, the employee is let go. But instead of terminating the employee on the date you set, Deel keeps paying the employee salary. Then when you identify the error, Deel starts calling the former employee to return the funds. When you ask about the return of the deposit, the Deel agent in some far away land tells you that you have to recover the funds from the former employee before any deposit is returned. How maddening is that! P.S. The tech support team is helpful and courteous.Date of experience: April 26, 2022",1

To make full use of this product I had to verify my identity by uploading either a bank statement or a utility bill with my address on it.I uploaded both of them, but each time I received a resubmission request, because the address on my Deel Card doesn't match the address on the bank statement. Since you can't change your address manually, I reached out to Deel support team via Live Chat and asked them to change my address information so that I can proceed with the verification. On the 6th of March, I got a confirmation from the Deel team that my address was changed, but no updates were indicated in my account.Since then I have been trying to upload my documents several times, but each time I got a resubmission request. I reached out to the support team one more time and they told me that they will update me in 2 days. 4.5 days after I recieved an email from the support team that they are still wotking on it and need more time to resolve this issue.I work for a UK based company, and this is my only source of income in my Deel account, so my case is completely transparent and legitimate.Date of experience: April 09, 2022",5

deel.com,"Overly invasive & drip feeds your dataOverly invasive & drip feeds your dataI am an independent contractor in Australia where I use a corporate entity - proprietary limited by shares - that was set up by my chartered accountant to deliver professional services to my global clientele.Or so I have done for a very long time and now suddenly I am forced to use some overly invasive middleman that does not add any real value yet has some rather interesting and scary authoritarian rigid approach to business to business transactions.If you ever have experienced yourself or read the horror stories about PayPal arbitrarily shutting down accounts and then in authoriative manner demanding your first born as well as your biometrics - you can probably relate to my experience already.I do not think they are compliant with AU privacy regulations and I don't feel safe for submitting my personal sensitive information - including biometrics - that reveals protected attributes about myself whilst exposing it to global consumption within unknown jurisdictions that openly opress people like me.They by their words seemingly use Veriff which is some AI startup from Estonia.Veriff on their website seems to say they do some arbitrary facial recognition off some databases. Very anxiety inducing and scary again without being transparent at all.It is not clear what the sole primary purpose for this sensitive information either is but there is some mindless nonsense about that they deal with banks -Well everyone is dealing with banks - Do they pretend being a bank without having a banking license in AU?I don't need another banking facility and I already have SWIFT facility for the clients to pay me for the work completed.Under AU privacy laws sensitive information must have a clear primary purpose and they don't really have a purpose since non-discriminatory alternatives exist.You cannot collect this information ""just in case"" - you must be enabled by the regulation and they are not.I can go to a notary and get a statutory declaration and this is what banks often use and is covered under AML/CTF implementation as a method to use if you are regulated entity even to begin with.During my 25 years of business I have not seen as a sloppy and invasive business practice as this related to handling identity information.Sensitive personal information is never required for simply receiving payment for services rendered especially if you work via corporate.Not only this but they require my accountant ID and run it into questionable facial recognition process.Stay off from this sloppy company.Date of experience: March 11, 2022",1

deel.com,"Desires Better - Lack of Transparency and Poor Quality of ServiceI used Deel first to hire a contractor in Japan, whom I later converted to an employee. Deel's Japan setup goes through a 3rd party and frankly has desired a lot more, especially for the amount I'm paying. Unfortunately, this is the only system that works for Japanese employees / contractors and I'd be penalized to leave <6 months after signing up, but I'd switch to a different system in a heart beat. A few of the issues - they auto-signed a contract that I had never seen on my behalf and had it in the system (fortunately they took it down, but had a bunch of hidden fees of the 3rd party and as far as I understand illegal), delayed the start date of my employee leaving a few weeks worth of gaps (without giving me any heads up and never letting me know of the issues - my employee had to deal with it - I had no idea this was going on until my employee flagged it up), and overall feels like they're nickel and diming me. If you don't have a new country set up - do your best to make the experience as smooth as possible, which is imperative with clear communication. Overall, a stressful and unpleasant experience with a provider I've lost trust in (and that's very disappointing for a hiring platform).Date of experience: January 25, 2022",2
deel.com,"I found my International Hiring Trusted Advisor!Hiring employees can be complicated enough in a country where you understand the hiring process, but having to consider candidates that reside in countries other than your “home” country is overwhelming.  Although I handle the mechanics of hiring employees into our organization, the HR/hiring process is not my area of expertise. I was THRILLED to find out about Deel.  From the very first sales call that I requested, the experience has been the best in terms of functionality of platform, benefit offerings and general ease of working with through the international hiring process.  The Account Executive I’ve been working with (Matt Kaiser) is fantastic.  He was able to read my tone/agenda quickly via our zoom meeting and was able to tailor our discussion to MY questions/needs rather than any pre-canned slide deck/pitch/discussion.  He was extremely responsive to all my follow-up questions about various parts of the onboarding process.   The feedback I received from the candidate that we used Deel to hire has been that it was a very straight-forward onboarding process with an easy-to-use portal.

Hopefully this is a turning point in the process and I will have no troubles. The only reason given for the poor service was that they have been restructuring the support department. I believe platforms like Deel have a very important role to play in the future of remote working and I do hope that my situation was an isolated one. *Changed the review from 1 star to 3**Original Review*Very dissapointing service repeatedly over 3 months. I have been working for a US company in the UK as a salaried employee, being paid through the Deel platform. Every month, so far, there have been issues, and every month support are unreachable and unwilling to assist me. I spent 3 hours waiting last month and am waiting for 3 hours currently again. Last month, when I finally got hold of someone, I was told the issue would be escalated and resolved but never heard back from support. This month I am waiting once again for support. Currently, I am sitting out of pocket for unpaid expenses as well as a portion of my salary from a system error their platform caused 3 months ago. The only person that can ever speak to anyone at Deel is my boss so I constantly have to complain there and then get a relayed messsage saying I can expect to be paid at the end of the month AGAIN but it doesn't happen and so the cycle will repeat.Date of experience: November 30, 2021",3

deel.com,"Funds trapped, no help from customer supportI've been unable to withdraw my funds from my Deel account for more than 20 days now. When I initiate a withdrawal, it just keeps pending and their customer support has been completely unhelpful. They initially told me that there's probably something wrong with my bank account details (doesn't help at all that the UI doesn't allow you to see the details of a bank account you've entered before), but I did eventually succeed in withdrawing a small amount through that account (with an unacceptable proportion lost to transaction fees of course), so I know the bank account information is fine.They have been unable to give me the slightest hint on what might be wrong about the transaction and all I get from them is ""We'll send you an email when we have more information"". I don't think this is an acceptable state of affairs for a platform that you're supposed to trust your money with.In the future, I'll simply provide my clients with a bank account and ask them to wire money directly into it. An intermediary like Deel adds nothing but complexity.Future edit: I've increased my score from 1 to 3 when my issue got resolved at the end of a month, at which point it was revealed that most of the delay was caused by third parties involved. However, I think Deel still contributed significantly to the difficulty of the situation through their complete lack of transparency into what was going on almost throughout this entire period.Edit from the further future: I've been working with Deel for almost 2 years now under a variety of (often very complicated) settings and I've decided to update my review score from 3 to 5 because even though they occasionally make mistakes in their processes, I've always been able to resolve even the most complicated issues with them thanks to their friendly and helpful support people and internal teams.Date of experience: September 01, 2021",5

Because I myself work in support at a management level, I used my experience to offer their clearly untrained ""support"" team advice on how they can actually potentially resolve my issue or at least reach an acceptable diplomatic compromise for both sides, which all fell on deaf ears.It seemed their attitude was ""let's send him around in circles and hope he just eventually disappears, trololol"".Their ""support"" team seems to be made up of untrained teenagers working part-time just for a little bit of cash to enable them to go clubbing and get drunk on the weekend. They do not seem genuinely concerned about clients and their money, nor with helping others. Deel needs to re-train or re-staff their entire ""support"" department. Money is a sensitive and stressful topic for a lot of people in our modern-day world, to the extent it can lead to serious mental health issues for some people. Deel's insensitive nature and appearing not to care that others have bills to pay or people to feed is only going to exacerbate these modern-day mental health issues.I hope Deel can stop chasing laser pointers and get their act together. In my time, I've seen companies collapse into ruin just because of poor support systems - the backbone, first impression and frontine of any company - coupled with their bad training and/or bad recruitment choices, it's a recipe for looming disaster.Date of experience: August 09, 2021",1
deel.com,"Incompetent is indeed the only wordIncompetent is indeed the only wordEach support gives wishy, washy different answers to questions I ask. Team seems young, inexperienced and either misled by leaders/lacking expertise in HR Product and product-flows look good on outside, but actually have lots of glitches/dont always workMarked up exchange rates seem to be the norm everyone accepts to order to use the platform but my company didnt tell me that when signing upI am planning to convince my company to switch to a better service or see if they can just pay me directly which was easierDate of experience: July 23, 2021",1
deel.com,"Incredible levels of incompetenceAt first glance, Deel looked like it was going to be incredibly helpful in getting paid for contracted remote work.However, after experiencing an issue with my account, I contacted support. Which has been the worst support experience I have ever had the misfortune of talking to (and I've spoken to Virgin Media, PayPal and EA Games before - all well-known for atrocious support. How wrong I was when I thought nobody could possibly be worse than them...).First of all, rather than one support agent dealing with my query, I was passed around to several different support agents like a cheap joint of weed. This is a terrible customer support system (I have experience in this sector), because a new support agent isn't going to be up to speed on the ongoing support process. One customer = one support agent, not several. The only excuse to pass a customer from one agent to another is if the previous agent is away due to sickness, maternity or vacation (again, I have experience in this sector).Because I was passed from person to person, I was constantly asked the same questions over and over that I had already answered with the previous support agents, which to me shows incredibly high levels of laziness and incompetence as they clearly were not reviewing the support history's discussion. None of them.Aside from that, I was also given completely different conflicting advice and answers from their support agents, which only dragged the whole thing on for longer trying to find out which support agents were right and which were wrong. This shows they have an extremely flawed training program for their support agents and none or lack of official documentations to guide their support agents to providing correct, consistent answers.It has taken over a month wresting with the spaghetti-style tangle that is Deel's support system and the issue is still not resolved. As a result, I have not been paid and Deel are now breaking the law in my country by being late with delivering my funds, so now I'm given no option but to inform my relevant government department that investigates employers and other payment processors when they are late paying citizens.Deel - Looks great and graceful on the outside. A tangled mess of confusion, incompetence, inconsistency and law-breaking late payments on the inside. AVOID like the plague.Date of experience: July 23, 2021",1
deel.com,"Complexity is not a core competencyAs a business, when we started using Deel we found the platform to be much simpler than other EORs out there. Unfortunately, employee contracts are not as straightforward as a simple interface and there are multiple areas to make sure are done correctly including accounting, specialized contracts, benefits etc. What I've found is that Deel can do the straightforward work but if there is any amount of complexity they do not have the systems in place to respond. For example, some contracts had been refunded but the statements on the accounting tab did not reflect the refunds, which resulted in a multi-week issue tracking down those payments. In addition, an employee asked to change terms in the contract and that took almost 2 months of back and forth (and created a host of other issues including an inability to sign up for healthcare). Most recently they added a 401k fee to all full-time contracts but did not provide a reasoning or an opt-out feature. It seems to me that they are trying to do too many things and as a result are not doing any of them well. At this time I do not recommend working with Deel.Date of experience: June 28, 2021",2
