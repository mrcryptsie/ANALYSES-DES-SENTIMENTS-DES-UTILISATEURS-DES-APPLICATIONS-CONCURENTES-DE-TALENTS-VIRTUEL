rippling.com,Lacey Taub,1 review,US,"Oct 25, 2022Invited","Rippling makes my daily work day easierRippling is one of, if not the easiest Employee Portal apps I have ever used. Payroll, Timekeeping, HR, Self-serve employment verification, everything I need in one place. They have an intuitive and easy to navigate interface, and they send alerts when my work devices need updates. It's easy to edit my clock in/out time, which is great because I don't have the best memory and it saves my manager loads of time (honestly, it saves everyone loads of time!)Date of experience: October 24, 2022",5

Its ability to do what we wanted to do at a price point that is reasonable for an early stage startup was invaluable.

rippling.com,Oscar Rivas,1 review,US,"Oct 14, 2022Invited","Choosing a health plan can be easyChoosing a health plan is always confusing. There are so many options to choose from that one never knows how to proceed or how to make the best decision.Rippling does a great job at showing each plan side by side, so you can compare and contrast and make the best educated decision. Also, the use or progressive disclosure is fantastic. You, as a customer, don't feel like you are bombarded with a thousand questions all at once. Instead, the questions are asked one at the time so you have time to digest them before moving to the next important question/decision/action. Overall, great experience. Great design thinking and execution.Date of experience: October 13, 2022",5

rippling.com,anonymous,5 reviews,US,"Jan 5, 2024Verified","Unethical CompanyI am en employee with a company that recently changed their payroll system to Rippling. For some reason, Rippling allowed our accounting team to upload my information without my permission and authorise a test transaction to my account without my knowledge or permission. I also have never been able to login to my account to control my information and Rippling blocks non-managers from contacting them. So all of my personal account information is locked in a system that I never was notified of or approved of and I cannot delete it or control. My bank had to block them because they are messing with my account without my permission. Scary and most likely illegal.Date of experience: December 26, 2023",1

rippling.com,Brooke Haag,3 reviews,US,"Updated Jun 28, 2023","Unexpected payroll adjustment and lack of transparencySeveral months ago Rippling shifted my paycheck without warning (a large paycut) to account for a tax withholding mistake they made. Eventually someone did reach out to me directly which I did appreciate, however, it had been months before that happened. Because of their mistake I will need to redo my previous year's taxes. In the end they did not explain why the mistake happened or make amends. I now have to reach out to the IRS to figure out next steps that will involve a balloon payment of thousands of dollars through no fault of my own.Date of experience: April 02, 2023",2
rippling.com,Kerridon Harrison,1 review,US,"Oct 14, 2022Invited","Rippling ExperienceFrom the very beginning, Jamila was the absolute best answering all of our questions and sending sample videos of how the software would work. Once we signed on, we had a one man show with Matt as our implementation GURU. To say that this has been the easiest of implementations is an understatement. Rippling makes onboarding new hires, payroll, termination simplified with one click. I cannot say enough with how happy we are with Rippling and their team! I know that there are so many other software platforms that will do many of the same tasks as Rippling, but for a small company on a budget, Rippling has saved us over $18,000 a year. That is money that we can put back into the company and invest in our people.Date of experience: October 13, 2022",5

rippling.com,Daanish Ahmed,1 review,US,"Jul 10, 2023","Rippling sets the bar high!I've used some large name payroll, HRIS, MDM, and spend management providers so I was skeptical to sign-up with a company that didn't have as big a name (they're growing QUICK!). This was the case especially with trusting a new company to manage paychecks, taxes, employees devices, onboarding/offboarding workflows, corp card spend controls, etc.Historically I was always under the notion that software providers should focus on getting ONE thing right. Rippling changed my take on this. They've been able to get every part of their product right. Having predominantly self-implemented Rippling, I now wonder why the big names make implementation such a heavy lift and then each time there is a tax related hiccup, it takes the village and days to get it resolved. I can easily recommend Rippling to HR and Accounting teams and know for sure that I will not be using any other provider given Rippling has set such a high bar!Date of experience: June 30, 2023",5
rippling.com,K King,8 reviews,US,"Mar 21, 2023","Honestly, worth the money. Worth every penny.They did a phenomenal job of keeping their clients up to date during the Silicon Valley Bank closure. They sent updates even when there weren't updates to hear, just to let everyone knew whatever it was that they knew.Overall I've noticed that whenever I need to get a hold of anyone at Rippling for ANYTHING, they're on top of it. Acknowledging emails, providing updates, proactively letting me know they're still waiting on another department for information, etc. Just amazing.We are actually only with them because our 401k company integrates with them but it turns out that Rippling was an amazing find and our 401k company is TERRIBLE, so we're keeping Rippling and ditching the dead weight.Date of experience: March 09, 2023",5

This platform is perfect for companies who are just starting up or who aren't content with their current platform and want to try something new. I also enjoy the color scheme and fun animations Rippling uses - when I get paid they send an email that I love looking at! It is always a cheerful animation with a clever play on words.

rippling.com,Victoria S.,1 review,US,"Oct 21, 2022Invited","First timer reviewThis is my first time using Rippling and it's been a good experience so far. It's very straight forward as both a manager and personal user. What I probably appreciate the most is onboarding. When I was onboarding employees on my team, it was a game changer that RIppling would automatically create logins for them for specific websites/technologies (like SFDC, Zoom). Rather than having to lean on HR or Operations to send logins, this was completed automatically. For me, the only ""down side"" about this platform is how complicated the login can be. The password criteria is very specific. And if you haven't used an ""Authenticator App"" before you will definitely need guidance. But I do understand most companies want their information secure so I can see why there are extra steps in place. It can just be a hassle if you are juggling other things.Date of experience: August 31, 2022",5

It's nice to be able to see HSA, Insurance, Payroll, and People all in one place. It's intuitive, and easy to use. Signing up for insurance is intuitive, but missing a couple nice functionality bits... make sure to only click ""Done"" when you're actually done... you won't be able to go back and edit. Also, it'd be nice to be able to see all benefits out of order instead of having to go and select in a specific order. Navigating the HSA section is easy. The only experience I've had that was pretty bad was the experience with Rpass. The Rpass tool is, while functionally working, is just a bad user experience. It's slow, laggy, and doesn't have a lot of feature options.

Pros;- The agent installs quickly.- Easy lookup of static documents and employee files. - Easy to use as an Admin or a regular user. - Integrates with our Google Workplace and Slack. - Booking and tracking time off is a breeze. - Locking and wiping laptops is simple.- Onboarding and Offboarding employees is straightforward and quick.  Cons;- No Canadian Payroll. - IT Device management is 80% smooth. - Occasionally a device will be connected to the internet, pinging to Rippling, but not responding to commands. - Occasionally MacBooks will hide the Rippling Admin log-in profile. - Doesn't stop a user from initiating a hard wipe of a computer. - Certain new employees only need to sign certain documents from our document list. The option to exclude specific documents exists (by deselecting them in the onboarding stage) but the feature does not work. All documents are included every time and you have to manually remove them. We've brought this up a couple times, so Rippling is aware of the issue, but there is no resolution yet.

rippling.com,Marie Q.,1 review,US,"Aug 16, 2023","Not Small Business FriendlyOur experience with Rippling has been awful for several reasons, but it just reached a peak that I had to come and leave a review. When we first signed up for Rippling, we added them as the third-party administrator to our tax accounts so the necessary payroll taxes would get paid accordingly. Months later, we received a letter from the IRS stating that the taxes for the first month we were with Rippling did not get paid and were owed to them plus fees for nonpayment. Rippling did nothing to remedy this, as they have it in their T&C that there is a time limitation as to when they'll cover such an issue.Then, due to transferring from another payroll provider, Rippling set us up with 2-day direct deposit. However, at one point, the business bank account from which direct deposit funds are drawn was short by a small amount. Rippling required that we wire the funds to them by the next day at a certain time, which we did. Yet, despite doing what they asked, they knocked us down to 4-day direct deposit, which completely threw off our entire payroll process. Most recently, we informed a Rippling representative that we would not be continuing with Rippling and would like to cancel our contract. He was sparse with responding and never cancelled our renewal. As a result, the contract AUTORENEWED, and we're trapped for another year. Needless to say, despite being stuck with them, we will not be using them and will be contacting our business lawyer immediately regarding this situation. Please stay far away from Rippling, especially if you're a small business owner.Date of experience: August 01, 2023",1

Rippling has managed to systematize this into a single and straightforward workflow, with clearly associated deadlines. Each step was well summarized for steps that needed no additional context (like, for me, HSA elections) and there were consistent ways to “dig deeper” when I needed more detail to make an informed election (e.g. accident insurance). The breakdown and cost at the end helped me understand the impact of the elections as well as confirmed that I didn’t make a mistake at one of the steps (e.g. I could see my dependents listed for each applicable benefit).

On Rippling, it's easy to switch between admin and employee views so I can manage my own account and approve timecards, time off requests, etc. for my direct reports with just a couple clicks. My only gripe about Rippling is the need to download a separate authenticator app on my phone for 2-factor authentication.

rippling.com,Matthew Samet,1 review,US,"Nov 16, 2021Invited","An intuitive, easy-to-use application.As a knowledge worker (magazine editor) who works within the corporate structure, I have for years—like so many of us—had to navigate third-party applications to get things done in my workplace. From accounting and invoicing, to content management, to HR needs like insurance, time off, payroll, etc., it's all done via app. And not all of these applications are created equal: Some are so confusing, cumbersome, and byzantine that I avoid them as much as possible, or try to find workarounds.With its bright, uncluttered, intuitive interface, Rippling has been a breath of fresh air, whether I'm using it through the browser, desktop app, or on my iPhone. The icons are clear, with mouse-over pop-up labels to remind you of functionality. The ""personal apps"" are all very easy to figure out: they are what they say they are (""Time Off,"" ""Payroll,"" ""Insurance,"" etc.)—nothing more and nothing less. And the structures and hierarchies within the subcategories are all very easy to navigate, both forward and backward. I think I have yet to get ""lost"" within the application or to need to use the support option, which has been far from the case with many similar apps in the past.So, well done Rippling on making my work life easier. Having such a smooth, breezy interface frees up my time to actually focus on my job, instead of tearing my hair out over time wasted on some sub-par application.Date of experience: November 16, 2021",5

rippling.com,Kim Nadeau,1 review,US,"Oct 19, 2021Invited","Consider carefully before signing upThe platform is not scalable for any growing company.  We've been told repeatedly that certain features exist, or function in a particular way, that don't.  The platform is not especially stable, especially when it comes to deductions.  It's too rigid and inflexible, not customizable at all, and both our customer service and implementation experience have not been good.  We have been with this platform for over a year, and it's still not a good experience.  There is very poor release management so menus and occasionally, actual features, change with little or no warning.  It might be fine for small, slow growing or no growing companies but if you are growing fast and scaling rapidly, find a different tool.  Reporting is not good.  They claim customizable reporting, but the output of the reports is highly unpredictable and often not usable. Most out of the box reports are not especially useful.Date of experience: October 19, 2021",1

rippling.com,Jamie Doyle,3 reviews,US,"Updated Oct 7, 2021","Bait and SwitchSo I was contacted via LinkedIn by a sales person asking me to demo their product. We are actually in the market for a new HR/payments platform so I accepted the invitation. Now, the system was fine, it was a good demo, but their baiting tactics left a really bad taste in my mouth. Numerous times pre demo they referenced a free gift card for scheduling the demo. They went so far as to ask me which one I wanted. Now, truth be told, I would have taken the demo anyway, however, after this experience I won't purchase the program. You shouldn't bait people with the promise of something and then not fulfill it. Its super sleazy and my emails with questions regarding the gift card have gone unanswered.UPDATE: I was contacted with an email that said here’s your $100 gift card… with a link to a $25 gift card. Come on people, you should be embarassed by this sales person’s behavior and follow through.Date of experience: October 06, 2021",1

rippling.com,Joseph Tapia,1 review,US,"Sep 30, 2021Invited","Rippling FeedbackWe use rippling for onboarding, HR paperwork and payroll. While I love the interface and the utility, some of the processes are confusing. For example, we've had a few times where we have employees in our system but they're not receiving emails for onboarding. We try updating the emails and ensuring all info is correct but still no email gets sent. Our workaround is having to delete and terminate the employee then remake their profile and have to resend offer letters. This is obviously not ideal so hopefully this can be made easier in the future. I do love the ""You just got paid"" emails. The layout of the paystubs look great and are easy to access and read.Date of experience: September 30, 2021",4
